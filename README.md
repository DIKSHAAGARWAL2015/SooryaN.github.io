### The calculator
Use the calculator like any other. Only a couple of things to keep in
mind.  
1. To evaluate +,\*,/,-, click on '=' button.
2. To evaluate other functions click on the operation itself.
 eg. to evaluate sin(5), simply click on sin, not '='.

7 8 9  
4 5 6  
1 2 3  
. 0 =
####main operators
DEL รท x - + CLR
####The extra functions
x^2 x^3 sin cos tan x!

##**The Javascript** 
There are two javascript files as part of the webpage:
1. clac.js: _script responsible for the functioning of the calculator_
2. tabs.js: _script for scrollable sticky nav and changing of calculator from normal to scientific_

##**The CSS**
Again there are two main style sheets responsible for the look of the page:
1. calc.css: _the style and scalability of the lolipop calculator_
2. tabs.css: _the style of the rest of the webpage_

There is also a stylesheet from the google fonts api for the [indie flower font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Indie+Flower)
